# YES Token Contracts — Yokefellow

This repository contains the verified smart contracts powering the **YOKEFELLOW EMPOWERMENT SHEKEL ($YES)** — the utility token at the heart of the Yokefellow economic engine.

Yokefellow is more than a project. It's a blueprint for funding overlooked builders — starting in Detroit and scaling across the world. This token isn't about hype, equity, or speculation — it's about **greenlighting real ideas** through bottom-up power, one fund at a time.
